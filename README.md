# 👋 Hi, I'm Georgia Aroni

I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Macedonia in Greece. I'm currently learning the basics of programming and software development — and enjoying the process of discovering this new world.

Before starting my studies, I worked for several years in e-commerce, where I handled:

- Customer support
- Social media and online ads (Meta, Google)
- ERP systems like Pylon and SoftOne
- Product listings and order management
- Website creation and maintenance using WordPress

That experience made me realize how much I enjoy working with technology and solving problems — and now I'm focusing on growing my skills as a developer.
